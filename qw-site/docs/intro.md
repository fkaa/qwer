# What is qwer.ee?

qwer.ee is a [open source](https://github.com/fkaa/qwer) livestreaming
website you can use together with your friends. It is _not_ a
replacement for *big-streaming-site.tv*.

Unlike other big streaming sites, it focuses on low latency video with
a small group of viewers. Interaction is assumed to exist outside of
qwer.ee, for example with a group voice call. There is no live chat
functionality.

## Why would I use this rather than X, Y, or Z?

Nobody is forcing you to! But qwer.ee is open source, low latency, and
does not require any registration to view streams.

## How do I use it?

Currently this instance (qwer.ee) requires an account to stream to,
and accounts are handed out manually.

If you do have an account, check out the [Streaming with
OBS](streaming/streaming-with-obs) page.

If you just want to watch a stream then see if there are any public
streams [here](/streams).
