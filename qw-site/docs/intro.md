# What is qwer.ee?

qwer.ee is a livestreaming website you can use together with your friends. It is _not_ a twitch.tv replacement.

## Huh? What's the difference?

Big streaming companies are backed by billions on top of billions of money, and we simply cannot compete with that.

In order for qwer.ee to function while not consuming all my life savings there are some tradeoffs that have to be made:

* There is only one video quality, the source material.
* There is a bandwidth cap per account.

## How do i use it?

If you want to watch a stream, find a public one in the list [here](/streams). If you want to stream you first need to create an account, then head over to [Introduction to streaming](streaming/intro.html)
